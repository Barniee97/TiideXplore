                The Lekki Conservation Centre canopy walkway is a scenic attraction and the longest in Africa. 
The 401- meter canopy walkway is an engineering feat and an amazing suspended swinging bridge walkway through 
the vegetation types that characterise the nature park. With entry and exit portals that connect six towers, 
it treats visitors to a unique and unforgettable experience. Visitors get to explore the park and get a bird’s
eye view of the various habitat types as they sight the unique wildlife that inhabits the Lekki Conservation Centre.
<!-- Just so you know, the climb is not for the timid; for only the brave and fearless climb the longest canopy walkway in 
Africa. Climbing this bridge will sure bring out the other side of you, especially if you’re a lady. While climbing, 
take precaution to stay close to other climbers and avoid looking down if you’re scared of heights. -->

                Useful tips to note when planning your visit to the Lekki Conservation Centre: if you plan to go during the rainy season, be prepared to get your feet wet because of the mini moody walkways. Wear comfy footwear (like sandals, trainers, plimsolls) not slippers or heels especially if you want to get on the canopy.<!-- Go with refreshments, take snacks along as there is no tuck shop to buy from. Keep your food safe from the monkeys except you have them in excess to share. It is better to keep the food until during the field games section, hold a carrier bag. Go with a nice camera or a fantastic camera phone -->

                <p class="project-brief">
                  If you love stage plays, then the national theatre is where to go. It can be very enthralling because there is a difference between watching DVD and a stage play. At the theatre, there is a cinema hall that has a capacity of 700 to 800 people.
                  <!--  So, when next you are probably going on a date, watching a stage would be an awesome idea. It can be a thrilling experience. -->

                  The National Theatre is not all about stage plays. You and your friends can drive to the theatre to relax and gulp some bottles at one of the bars while exchanging banters in a very inviting and conducive environment. The food is substantially affordable.
